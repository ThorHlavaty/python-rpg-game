Thanks for checking this out. I built this as a way to practice with Classes in python. It took about 12-14 hours all together. I wanted to keep it pretty basic, but then I kept adding little things like ASCII and different ways characters could attack. It's unbalanced and short, but I'm really happy with it as a practice method.

To run: Assuming you have python3 
-in the terminal navigate to the folder that has the game
-in the terminal, type out " python3 game.py " without the quotes
-enjoy! It's a very short game. If you manage to win as the Sorcerer, let me know! She's real bad.
